# Invoice-Generator-VBA
The pupose of this project was to create a digital record of customer orders. At our business, even in 2024 we were relying on solely written invoices. Invoices would get lost, order disputes would occur, and statistical analysis was done by hand. Digital data storage was needed. Due to this, I created an excel program that could quickly gather data that could be used to run stats. This helped the company greatly in that the reliance on less paper saved time and money, and shipments were organized with more efficiency. Furthermore, aggregations and visualizations led us to find weak points in our business practices. Changes were made because of this, leading to a 20% increase in revenue udring the second half of 2024. I will leave a Quik overveiw below. Bear in mind the project uploaded to this github page has been stripped of any customer information and fake sample data was used instead. 

Overwiew: 
This Excel VBA program stores cutomer and order data, tracks order details, and runs statisical functions. This program lead to more efficient order management, status communcation, etc. 

Features: 
-Data entry done by users choice, either cell by cell input, or a user form 
-Customer orders tracked by quantity, date, tag numbers, phone numbers, etc
-Given conditional statements in VBA (ex. if Status = 'Paid'), aggregations run on data to calculate total revenue, etc
- Buttons and user from added on to allow user to interact with the invoice generator
  
Install/setup
